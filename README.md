# EMPTY-BUCKET
This is a small project for Movie Seat Booking done in C++ for third semester lab project.

It includes user signup, recharging user wallet by pin code, booking a movie seat, etc.
There is not any platform for admin user. Admin have to manually change the data(movie, price, show date, no of seat, etc) in text files.
